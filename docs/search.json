It is recognized as the largest global community of statisticians, often referred to as the “Big Tent for Statistics.” The ASA is dedicated to promoting excellence in the creation, application, and distribution of statistical science. This is achieved through various means such as organizing meetings, publishing research, providing services to members, offering education, granting accreditation, and advocating for the field.\nIn addition to these, the ASA also provides professional development programs for early-career statisticians and data scientists. It offers a platform for its members to connect with a global community of statisticians working in various sectors including industry, government, and academia. These members contribute to advancing research, promoting sound statistical practice, informing public policy, and improving human welfare."
